# Harmonic Reels Visualizer

A generative art sketch that renders glowing circular patterns synchronized with music — **featuring real-time sound reactivity, hue-shifting background, and radial motion**.

---

## Concept

This project explores:

- Radial symmetry and particle motion
- Live audio frequency analysis (bass, mid, treble)
- Background color shifting based on bass
- Rotation, glow, and rhythmic pulsation
- Sound-synchronized ring deformation

---

## What Happens?

- Particles are placed in a circle and animated outward using Perlin noise
- The **radius**, **color**, and **glow** of each particle respond to the music’s energy
- The background hue changes dynamically with the bass
- The full composition rotates continuously to create motion flow

---

## Tools

- `p5.js` for canvas rendering
- `p5.sound` for frequency analysis
- `HSB` color mode
- `blendMode(ADD)` for brightness bloom
- Rotation and Perlin noise for organic movement
