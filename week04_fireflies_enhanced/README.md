# Week 04: Fireflies in Motion

A generative art sketch built with **p5.js**, featuring dreamy fireflies that drift through space using **Perlin noise**, **depth-based glow**, and **sound-reactive flicker**.

---

##  Concept
Inspired by nature and ambient visuals, this piece simulates fireflies that:
- Move smoothly with Perlin noise
- Glow with variable brightness
- React to mouse position and sound
- Leave subtle motion trails

---

##  What You’ll See
- A soft field of floating fireflies
-  Glow effects layered using `blendMode(ADD)`
-  Fireflies repelling when the mouse is near or clicked
-  Dynamic flicker intensity based on ambient sound

---

## Tools
- `p5.js` for canvas rendering and animation
- `p5.sound` for sound input and amplitude analysis
- JavaScript ES6 Classes and OOP

---

## To Run It
Open `index.html` in a browser that supports Web Audio and p5.js.
