#  Week 03 â€“ Fractal Symmetry with Cello Sound

This generative artwork visualizes a recursively growing tree that gradually blossoms with soft movement and color transitions. As it grows, it is accompanied by a looping cello recording, creating a meditative audiovisual experience.

###  Features
- Recursive tree structure (fractal branching)
- Gradual animated growth
- Color gradient based on depth
- Stroke weight and alpha fading for depth
- Subtle sway animation using `sin(frameCount)`
- Ambient cello soundtrack (looped)
