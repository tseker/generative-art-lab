# Week 05: Flow Field Sound Particles

A generative art sketch where hundreds of particles drift through an invisible vector field defined by Perlin noise — **with sound-reactive motion, brightness, and color**.

---

##  Concept

This project explores:

-  Flow fields via Perlin noise
-  Real-time sound amplitude interaction
-  Dynamic color cycling (HSL)
-  Glow trails and movement memory
-  Visual harmony with minimal interaction

---

##  What Happens?

- Particles follow invisible directions created by Perlin noise
- Their **speed**, **color**, and **trail brightness** respond to the ambient sound
- The result is a meditative, organic field of motion


---

## Tools

- `p5.js` for drawing and animation
- `p5.sound` for amplitude analysis
- `HSL` color space
- `blendMode(ADD)` for glow
- Vector math and particle classes
